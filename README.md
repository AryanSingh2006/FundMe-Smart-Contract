# FundMe-Smart-Contract
FundMe is a Solidity smart contract that accepts ETH only if it meets a set USD minimum. It uses Chainlinkâ€™s decentralized price feeds to fetch real-time ETH/USD rates, converting ETH to USD on-chain. Ideal for crowdfunding or payment systems needing fiat-equivalent value enforcement.
